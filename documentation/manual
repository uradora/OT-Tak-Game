## Adding users and selecting game board size

These options don't exist yet.

## Playing the game

The game is started by clicking on an empty tile. A game piece will appear in the tile. The piece color corresponds to the active player's color. White will go first as the active player, and turn order is switched each time a piece is moved or placed. Each player has 15 pieces available to place and the GUI keeps track of turn order and how many pieces the players have left.

The goal of the game is to make one complete 'road' from one end of the game board to the next.

Functionalities for moving multiple game pieces and counting game wind conditions will be added soon.
